# Word Disks
A word game using the `react-disks` package.

## How To Play?
Rotate the disks so every column of letters spells a valid word in the `random-words` package's word list.

You can rotate a disk by clicking on it, and then clicking either the clockwise or counterclockwise arrows that appear.

## Settings
The following settings are configurable in the game:

- number of words

- number of disks

- whether letters should be uppercase or lowercase

- on mobile touch devices, whether disks can be rotated via swipe gestures instead
